## Next Steps

1. Review the 3 files already created
2. Prioritize which remaining files are most important
3. I can create them individually or in batches
4. Some files may be outdated and can be archived

**Recommendation**: Focus on recreating the HIGH PRIORITY files first, as they document core features. Status files can be regenerated based on current project state.
